Always looking to simplify things where possible, without sacrificing the end result.</p>

    <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
    <h3 id="javascript">Javascript</h3>
    <p>Very strong, in-depth understanding of the language and its quirks. Experience in implementing large scale visual applications &amp; charts, as well as more standard functionality such as form validation, image carousels and custom controls. Familiar with common tools such as React, Gulp and the Google Maps API.</p>
    <h3 id="html-css-svg">HTML/CSS/SVG</h3>
    <p>Extensive up-to-date knowledge of the modern browser stack including semantic HTML, FlexBox/Grid and mobile/responsive design.

Understanding of SASS/SCSS/Stylus features such as @extend.</p>
    <h3 id="php-coldfusion-net">PHP/Coldfusion/.NET</h3>
    <p>Designing and building a number of back ends for e-commerce, CMS, CRM and several more esoteric systems, in a variety of languages and platforms. A holistic approach to web development has led to a broad understanding of back end tasks such as automation, data storage and 3rd party integrations, which has allowed for the development of several highly data-driven apps and tools. </p>
    <h3 id="sql">SQL</h3>
    <p>Mainly SQL Server but a degree of familiarity with MySQL &amp; Postgres. Knowledge of querying and database design subjects such as indexing and normalisation and a desire to keep the data as “readable” as possible, coupled with an interest in ORM data abstractions and the related architecture.</p>
    <h3 id="other">Other</h3>
    <p>Familiarity with an array of non-programming aspects of web development, including Git and managing IIS and Apache. Run Linux full time where possible and confident on the command line (both Bash and CMD/Powershell).

    <h3 id="senior-front-end-developer-lightfoot">Senior Front End Developer – Lightfoot</h3>
    <p><strong>Sep 2020 - Present</strong></p>
    <p>Hired to fill a front-end skills gap in the team, initially put to work fixing up a vehicle tracking SPA built by 3rd party contractors. Prior knowledge of mapping applications proved vital in understanding and taming the pre-existing codebase, and in converting “React” code into something closer to idiomatic React. The learning gained from this is now being applied in a wider rebuild of the entire &quot;portal&quot; area to facilitate backend requirements to have all data operations running through the new, scalable API.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Interpretation and maintenance of existing React codebase to fix broken functionality and add new features</li>
    <li>Improving and fixing CI tasks such as automated builds and testing, in particular rewriting a puppeteer script and creating a standalone testing environment for the SPA in Docker.</li>
    <li>Involved in front-end architecture work, planning use of CSS frameworks and how to reign in the various different JS approaches used in the legacy codebase.</li>
    <li>Using UI/UX knowledge to assist the wider team when planning new features.</li>
    <li>Providing input for back-end developers to streamline APIs; collaborating to implement rich, data-driven functionality for stakeholders</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Working at a small creative agency on a variety of projects, mostly using CraftCMS and React. While initially employed to work on front-end and user experience it quickly became apparent that there was work to do back end too, so a knack for the full web stack led to considerable work on data model and integration tasks alongside the various interactive tools and features.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Use of React to build up interfaces from designs, both developing custom components and integrating 3rd party ones (such as mapping tools used on www.parksandgardens.org/map)</li>
    <li>Configuration and customisation of PHP backends (CraftCMS and Yii) to integrate with 3rd party APIs and process large datasets for consumption by the frontend</li>
    <li>Rapid implementation of high quality bespoke builds such as <a href="http://brands.withvalues.com">http://brands.withvalues.com</a></li>
    <li>Used knowledge of SVG to quickly produce a CMS driven diagram for an education non-profit: www.thinkingmatters.com/services/consultancy-and-cpd-training</li>
    <li>Heavy cross browser compatibility work using Babel for transpilation from ES6, with Browserstack for testing</li>
    <li>Redevelopment of Gulp build tools to reduce technical debt and streamline the build &amp; deployment processes</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Design and build of several complex interactive SVG charting tools, including one that needed to handle tens of thousands of datapoints and another to process statistical calculations in realtime</li>
    <li>Optimisation of user access privileges in the backend framework using SQL stored procedures and lookup tables to dramatically improve the speed of all requests to the system</li>
    <li>Use of Cordova to produce an app to run on both iOS and Android, using a REST API to send and receive video and storyboarding data</li>

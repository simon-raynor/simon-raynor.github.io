    <p>An experienced web developer with a heavy focus on the front end, passionate about user experience and with a good eye for the details. Exposure to different environments and tech stacks has fostered a pragmatic “get it done” attitude while supporting long-term projects has made sure “get it right” is prioritised equally. Always looking to simplify things where possible, without sacrificing the end result.</p>

    <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
    <h3 id="javascripttypescript">Javascript (+ Typescript)</h3>
    <p>Very strong, in-depth understanding of the language and its quirks. Experience in architecting and implementing large scale visual applications &amp; charts, as well as more standard functionality such as form validation, image carousels and custom controls. Familiar with common tools &amp; frameworks such as React, Webpack and the Google Maps API. Typescript, while not my first choice for "fun" code, has won me over especially on larger projects.</p>
    <h3 id="htmlcsssvg">HTML/CSS/SVG</h3>
    <p>Extensive up-to-date knowledge of the modern browser stack including semantic HTML, FlexBox/Grid and mobile/responsive design. Liberal use of SVG, both statically for icons &amp; presentation and for dynamically building interactive interfaces for data visualisation/charting, as well as for less serious projects. Understanding of SASS/SCSS/Stylus features such as @extend.</p>
    <h3 id="backendsql">Backend &amp; SQL</h3>
    <p>Designing and building a number of back ends for e-commerce, CMS, CRM and several more esoteric systems; in a variety of languages and platforms. A holistic approach to web development has led to a broad understanding of back end tasks such as automation, data storage and 3rd party integrations, which has allowed for the development of several highly data-driven apps and tools. Knowledge of querying and database design subjects such as indexing and normalisation and a desire to keep the data as “readable” as possible, coupled with an interest in ORM data abstractions and the related architecture.</p>
    <h3 id="other">Other</h3>
    <p>Familiarity with an array of non-programming aspects of web development, including Git and managing IIS and Apache. Run Linux full time where possible and confident on the command line (both Bash and CMD/Powershell). Soft skills including prioritisation, time estimation/management, mentoring teammates and liaising with clients &amp; client-facing colleagues for planning &amp; troubleshooting. Strong mathematics skills, in particular geometry, and ability to convert “maths equations” into functional code.</p>

    <h3 id="seniorfrontenddeveloperlightfoot">Senior Front End Developer &ndash; Lightfoot</h3>
    <p><strong>Sep 2020 - Present</strong></p>
    <p>Hired to fill a front-end skills gap in the team, initially put to work fixing up a fleet tracking SPA built by 3rd party contractors. Prior knowledge of mapping applications proved vital in understanding and taming the pre-existing codebase, and in converting “React” code into something closer to idiomatic React. Was subsequently tasked with spearheading a rebuild of the rest of the Lightfoot portal, both to facilitate backend requirements and to improve maintainability and DX, where the larger scale of the project led to embracing libraries like redux and react-i18n to provide a truly "pro" solution.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Interpretation and maintenance of existing React codebase to fix broken functionality and add new features, followed by heading a project to create a drop-in replacement</li>
    <li>Improving and fixing CI tasks such as automated builds and testing, in particular creating a standalone testing environment for our SPA in Docker</li>
    <li>Involved in front-end architecture work, planning use and development of component frameworks and how to reign in the various different JS approaches used in the legacy codebase</li>
    <li>Using UI/UX knowledge to assist the wider team when planning new features</li>
    <li>Providing input for back-end developers to streamline APIs; collaborating to implement rich, data-driven functionality for stakeholders</li>
    <li>Mentorship of full-stack colleagues to get them up-to-speed with React and Typescript (and sometimes I pick holes in their CSS too)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="frontenddeveloperyellostudio">Front End Developer &ndash; Yello Studio</h3>
    <p><strong>Apr 2019 &ndash; Dec 2019</strong></p>
    <p>Working at a small creative agency on a variety of projects, mostly using CraftCMS and React. While initially employed to work on front-end and user experience it quickly became apparent that there was work to do back end too, so a knack for the full web stack led to considerable work on data model and integration tasks alongside the various interactive tools and features.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Use of React to build up interfaces from designs, both developing custom components and integrating 3rd party ones (such as mapping tools used on <a href="www.parksandgardens.org/map">www.parksandgardens.org/map</a>)</li>
    <li>Configuration and customisation of PHP backends (CraftCMS and Yii) to integrate with 3rd party APIs and process large datasets for consumption by the frontend</li>
    <li>Rapid implementation of high quality bespoke builds such as <a href="http://brands.withvalues.com">http://brands.withvalues.com</a></li>
    <li>Used knowledge of SVG to quickly produce a CMS driven diagram for an education non-profit (no longer online)</li>
    <li>Heavy cross browser compatibility work using Babel for transpilation from ES6, with Browserstack for testing</li>
    <li>Redevelopment of Gulp build tools to reduce technical debt and streamline the build &amp; deployment processes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="softwareengineerseedataltd">Software Engineer &ndash; Seedata LTD.</h3>

Prior to the creation of LifeQI worked on a wide array of different systems including: a mobile video app for iOS &amp; Android, a 2D kitchen worktop planner tool, a map based feedback tool, large scale biostratigraphy charting for the oil &amp; gas industry and several CMS, CRM &amp; e-commerce systems.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Rebuilding the in-house Javascript framework from the ground up to allow for a more flexible, modular approach to interfaces</li>
    <li>Worked closely with design team to develop and implement a consistent design language across systems</li>
    <li>Recognising the need to provide clients with custom reporting and analytics led to the development of a “CMS style” data-driven report generator tool, allowing for almost unlimited flexibility in the outputs</li>
    <li>Design and build of several complex interactive SVG charting tools, including one that needed to handle tens of thousands of datapoints and another to process statistical calculations in realtime</li>
    <li>Optimisation of user access privileges in the backend framework using SQL stored procedures and lookup tables to dramatically improve the speed of all requests to the system</li>
    <li>Use of Cordova to produce an app to run on both iOS and Android, using a REST API to send and receive video and storyboarding data</li>
    <li>Production of a number of different dynamic PDF outputs including charts and graphs, reusing and adapting the frontend output code to work via WKHTMLTOPDF</li>
    <li>Introduction of tools such as SASS and Gulp to allow for better organisation of CSS and SVG icon assets</li>

			My name is Simon and I make websites. Kinda. It's a bit more complicated
			than that &ndash; the things I make tend to be a fair bit more involved than just
			words on a screen &ndash; but that's what I tell people when I don't want to bore
			them too much.
		</p>
		<p>
			Professionally I tend to work on data-heavy frontends, often producing large
			scale visualisations or professional quality CRUD interfaces. That stuff tends to be
			both copyright and slightly dull though so on <em>this</em> site I'm putting the fun bits I
			work on in my free time.
		</p>
		<p>Welcome!</p>

			Most recently I revisited some CSS animation as it had been a while since I'd refreshed my
			knowledge. Turns out that with the advent of CSS properties and the implementation of more
			and more CSS features (different gradients and transforms and filters and whatnot) you can
			create effects today that would have been impossible with CSS alone 10 years ago.
		</p>
		<p>
			I actually made this <a
				href	= "./demos/fancy-modal/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>modal open animation</a> after seeing a "how can this be done with CSS?" question on Reddit.
			It piqued my interest enough that I had a crack and got pretty damn close (if I do say so myself).
			While fiddling with that animation I got a few ideas for other ways to take it and so made this <a
				href	= "./demos/superfancy-modal/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>demo of different modal opening animations</a> to try some of them out. The result was a number
			of very simple to code CSS animations that could be adapted and combined to almost any aesthetic,
			and I'm genuinely excited to slip a few in to my future work projects.

			A while back I spent a good bit of time learning ThreeJS and WebGL. I think it really
			got me interested when I saw <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_gpgpu_birds.html">
			this demo of flocking birds</a>, which I dissected until I could produce this <a
				href	= "./demos/butterflies/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>box full of butterflies</a>. The same approach was then streamlined from 3D into 2D and
			combined with some other fun techniques (such as generating a flow field based on the HTML)
			to produce the "ones and zeroes" effect you're seeing on this page.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also half built a couple of game demo type things with ThreeJS. The first is a sort of <a 
				href	= "./demos/rhombic/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>cave-based maze/exploraton</a> deal, using a rhombic dodecahedral
			lattice to prodcedurally generate the environment. The second is a more open <a
				href	= "./demos/unnamed-asteroid-miner/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>asteroid/space vibe</a>, which I think looks really cool even if it's kinda unfinished. There's
			a lot of shader magic in both of those but particularly the asteroid one, as well as things like
			game chunk loading and seed based "terrain" generation (at least the begginings of). The problem
			I've had with both concepts is that while I can make something that <em>looks</em> like a game it
			is a very different proposition to make something that is also fun/engaging to play. I've parked both
			projects until I can come up with a compelling use case (and then I'll probably just strip 'em for
			parts).

			I've dabbled with 3D rendering before getting into ThreeJS.
			<a
				href	= "./demos/geometry-demo/"
			>Here's the platonic solids rotating in 3-space</a>, rendered using SVG.
			I used the same renderer to make <a
				href	= "./demos/geometry-demo-2/"
			>this interpretation of the concept (give it a click!)</a> It lacks some
			of the finesse of WebGL but it really helped me to understand a lot of
			important concepts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Probably the best thing I made through this technique<sup>3</sup> was a <a
				href="./demos/playbutton/"
			>"play" button</a>. It's fun to click and actually almost makes sense
			to use over a more "full fat" solution like webgl. It would also be
			relatively easy to extend to different icons etc., maybe one day I'll
			use it in production (there's one bottom right that's a strong candidate).
		</p>
		<p><small>
			3. Technically a slightly different technique (a 2D canvas instead of SVG)
			but most of the code is the same</small></p>

			Animations and cool graphics is what got me in to webdev in the first place. Over
			the years I've made dozens of little things to test an idea or learn a concept.
			Here's a <a
				href	= "./demos/plants/"
			>half-baked concept for a homepage.</a>
			Here's another concept <a
				href	= "./demos/slides/"
			>playing with transitions between sections of content</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a few more bits of old concept stuff which I may clean up and put here, just
			need to work out what's worth saving from my archives Vs working on new stuff.
			A lot of bits don't even get finished enough to demo as I'll get what I need from
			it learning-wise and just move on to the next thing. I'm sure I can dig out at least
			<em>one</em> fractal though, if for no reason other than to live up to cliches.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally <a
				href	= "./demos/javascroids/"
			>here's an actual finished game I built many years ago</a>.
			Keyboard controls means <strong>it doesn't work on mobile</strong> &ndash;
			that's why I left it 'till last &ndash; but I'm still quite proud of it. Yes it's
			really just an asteroids clone at heart but it has progression, high scores,
			some nice graphics and (considering I was a noob when I built it) really stable
			performance. I hope to repeat the whole "actually finishing an ambitious project"
			with the new game mentioned above.

			I will be adding more here, at some point, weather permitting. In building this very
			page I've kicked a hornets' nest of flow fields to add to my already noisy agenda
			of GLSL, procedural generation, nonsense Javascript abstractions and misuse of CSS.
			I have no idea what I'm going to build next but you can bet I'll spend far too long
			tinkering with it :D

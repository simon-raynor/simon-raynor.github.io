			My name is Simon and I make websites. Kinda. It's a bit more complicated
			than that (think Google Maps or Facebook) but that's what I tell people
			when I don't want to bore them. Hopefully the fun little projects on
			display here will show the kind of stuff I enjoy building.

			Most recently I've been working on getting good with ThreeJS. I shamelessly
			dissected the "flocking" example<sup>1</sup> until I understood it well enough to do a <a
				href	= "./demos/butterflies/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>version with butterflies</a><sup>2</sup>. That is merely a step on the path to building
			something a bit more substantial: <a
				href	= "./demos/rhombic/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>a (very work-in-progress) fully featured game</a><sup>2</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>NOTE:</strong> the game doesn't
			even use the learning from the butterflies yet!

		<p><small>2. For technical reasons these links will open in a new window. I could probably make my super lazy demo loader work for them but then it wouldn't be a super lazy demo loader anymore</small></p>

			I've dabbled with 3D rendering before getting into ThreeJS.
			<a
				href	= "./demos/geometry-demo/"
			>Here's the platonic solids rotating in 3-space</a>, rendered using SVG.
			I used the same renderer to make <a
				href	= "./demos/geometry-demo-2/"
			>this interpretation of the concept (give it a click!)</a> It lacks some
			of the finesse of WebGL but it really helped me to understand a lot of
			important concepts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Probably the best thing I made through this technique<sup>3</sup> was this <a
				href="./demos/playbutton/"
			>"play" button</a>. It's fun to click and actually almost makes sense
			to use over a more "full fat" solution like webgl. It would also be
			relatively easy to extend to different icons etc., maybe one day I'll
			use it in production.
		</p>

			3. Technically a slightly different technique (a 2D canvas instead of SVG)
			but most of the code is the same</small></p>

			<a
				href	= "./demos/plants/"
			>Here's a half-baked concept for a homepage.</a> It uses JS modules
			so it might not work if your browser is on the older side.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a
				href	= "./demos/slides/"
			>Here's another concept</a> playing with transitions between sections of
			content. I'm pretty confident that the basic approach is sound, I just
			need to work out what to do with it!

			My name is Simon and I make websites. Kinda. It's a bit more complicated
			than that &ndash; the things I make tend to be a fair bit more involved than just
			words on a screen &ndash; but that's what I tell people when I don't want to bore
			them too much.
		</p>
		<p>
			Professionally I tend to work on data-heavy frontends, often producing large
			scale visualisations or professional quality CRUD interfaces. That stuff tends to be
			both copyright and slightly dull though so on <em>this</em> site I'm putting the fun bits I
			work on in my free time.

		<p>Welcome!</p>

			Recently I've been working on getting good with ThreeJS. I shamelessly dissected
			the "flocking" example<sup>1</sup> until I understood it well enough to build a <a
				href	= "./demos/butterflies/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>box full of butterflies</a><sup>2</sup>. I've then taken that learning and
			applied it to the page you're on now, streamlining the 3D "physics" to a much
			less complicated 2D vesion that still gives me all the control I need (for now).
			It's very much a work-in-progress, eventually I'll have all kinds of stuff flying
			around!
		</p><p>
			I'm also working on-and-off on a <a
				href	= "./demos/rhombic/"
				target	= "_blank"
			>cave-based game</a><sup>2</sup> to really push my abilities. Frankly it's still in
			the early design stages, while I have a rough idea what I want to build I need to
			put thought into things like objectives and purpose within the game. There's also
			tons of modelling, animation, texturing, coding, etc. etc. to do too, so I'm sure to
			have plenty to keep me busy. Heck at some point I need to think about audio! I'm open to any
			and all feedback and suggestions so have a go on the demo and let me know what you think.

			I've dabbled with 3D rendering before getting into ThreeJS.
			<a
				href	= "./demos/geometry-demo/"
			>Here's the platonic solids rotating in 3-space</a>, rendered using SVG.
			I used the same renderer to make <a
				href	= "./demos/geometry-demo-2/"
			>this interpretation of the concept (give it a click!)</a> It lacks some
			of the finesse of WebGL but it really helped me to understand a lot of
			important concepts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Probably the best thing I made through this technique<sup>3</sup> was a <a
				href="./demos/playbutton/"
			>"play" button</a>. It's fun to click and actually almost makes sense
			to use over a more "full fat" solution like webgl. It would also be
			relatively easy to extend to different icons etc., maybe one day I'll
			use it in production (there's one bottom right that's a strong candidate).
		</p>
		<p><small>
			3. Technically a slightly different technique (a 2D canvas instead of SVG)
			but most of the code is the same</small></p>

			Animations and cool graphics is what got me in to webdev in the first place. Over
			the years I've made dozens of little things to test an idea or learn a concept.
			Here's a <a
				href	= "./demos/plants/"
			>half-baked concept for a homepage.</a>
			Here's another concept <a
				href	= "./demos/slides/"
			>playing with transitions between sections of content</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a few more bits of old concept stuff which I may clean up and put here, just
			need to work out what's worth saving from my archives Vs working on new stuff.
			A lot of bits don't even get finished enough to demo as I'll get what I need from
			it learning-wise and just move on to the next thing. I'm sure I can dig out at least
			<em>one</em> fractal though, if for no reason other than to live up to cliches.

			Finally <a
				href	= "./demos/javascroids/"
			>here's a game I built many years ago</a>.
			It won't work on mobile which is why I've put it at the bottom but I'm still
			proud of it. Yes it's just an asteroids clone but it has progression, high scores,
			some nice graphics and (considering I was a noob when I built it) really stable
			performance.

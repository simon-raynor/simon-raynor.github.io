			My name is Simon and I make websites. Kinda. It's a bit more complicated
			than that (think Google Maps or Facebook) but that's what I tell people
			when I don't want to bore them. Hopefully the fun little projects on
			display here will show the kind of stuff I enjoy building.

			I'll do something cool with it someday (once I iron out

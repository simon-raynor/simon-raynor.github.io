I decided to go with a minimal design as I felt obsessing over looks wouldn't
be an efficient use of time here. I put in quite a few complex features and
this is reflected in the quality of my code. In the real world more effort
would be put into architecture and maintainability, there would probably
even be some useful comments!

I'm not actually sure which part of this data is most important to users,
or how they would be analysing it, so I had to make some guesses as to
what to implement. Similarly I chose to only bother making a bar chart
as I knew they're usually correct, even when they're not ideal. It would
be fairly trivial to add different outputs, however, as the chart drawing
stuff is fairly extensible.

In hindsight maybe some kind of "pick your axes" chart tool might have
been a better concept but I like what's here and think it looks cool :D
Hopefully you do too!

(P.S. you can click on the charts and the "year"/"road" map labels)

			Here is my submission for the assigned task. I've tried to interpret
			the brief as best I can however in real life I would want to liase
			with other members of the team to get a better handle on how the
			thing should behave and animate. It is also missing the final polish
			due to a lack of sign-off from a stakeholder, I'm quite averse to
			finalising things without knowing they're "correct".
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm relatively happy with the overall approach I've taken here, in
			particular generating an SVG to handle all the graphical stuff seems
			like the best option by far. In an actual implementation we'd
			want to do this serverside or as part of a build script, as such the
			<a href="./build.js">build code</a> has been written to output strings
			so that it's easy to port to a gulpfile or similar. Alternatively
			it could likely be produced from the design software then tweaked, though
			obviously that wasn't an option here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Originally I'd set this up to switch on clicking the list items (which
			is why they are buttons). The very simple handler is commented out
			at the top of <a href="./main.js">animation code</a>, after playing
			with the animations I realised the direction I'd taken did not work too
			well when the icons were selected out of order (the arrows made no sense)
			so I switched to an autorotating carousel type thing. It's running far
			too fast for production but I didn't want to have a ~10 second wait in
			this demo.
		</p>
		<p>
			All of the animations are simple CSS transitions, which makes them
			pretty easy to modify. The code uses <code>transitionend</code> handlers
			wrapped in promises to chain them, an approach I've used successfully
			in the past, however this particular implementation probably needs a
			bit of work (especially if we need to allow for user interaction). It does
			lead to fairly easy to follow animations though, even with imperfect code.
		</p>
		<p>
			I don't like how the arrow is visible under the icon as it expands but
			I don't have a (quick) solution for it so I decided it was acceptable
			for now. There's also quite a lot of room to improve the animations I
			think but would require more understanding of the designer's intention
			and the client's needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the whole I'm happy with how this has turned out. I spent about a
			workday on it and am confident that, with collaboration with teammates
			etc., I could have got this totally finished in around 8 to 10 hours.
			Possibly even less depending on whether code/assets could be reused from
			elsewhere. Of course I've totally ignored mobile for this task beyond
			a very, very basic layout change; that would likely need some serious
			though prior to starting any of it!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Addendum:</strong> in the spirit of full disclosure I've
			just noticed a bug if you de-focus the window. That would need fixing
			prior to release, obviously! (I think it's probably due to the transition
			handlers not firing on unfocussed windows, though I'm not certain)

If you were looking for a pixel-perfect demonstration of my design skills
here you're gonna be sorely disappointed. I decided to go minimal design
as I felt it wouldn't be an efficient use of time. The code quality is also
kinda bad as I went for quantity over quality of features.

The main things I wanted to do are done, however pretty much
everything here is at a first draft proof-of-concept level and is
missing a lot of functionality. Things like labels, colours and better
interactivity would have been added to the charts had I had the time.
The data handling in particular wants refactoring, but as it's a demo
I didn't spend too much time on actually engineering good quality code.

I'm not actually sure which part of this data is most important to users,
or how they would be analysing it, so I had to make some guesses as to
what to implement. Similarly I chose to only bother making a bar chart
output as I knew they're usually correct, even when they're not ideal.
While it arguably took way too long to find/clean the data I'm glad I did
the roadmap plotter thing. With more time I'd have made it zoom to points
when clicked and stuff like that, though there's a part of my brain that
keeps telling me it's not that useful a datavis tool.

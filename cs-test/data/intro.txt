I decided to go minimal design as I felt obsessing over looks wouldn't be
an efficient use of time here. The code quality is also kinda bad as I went
for quantity over quality of features, and was making up stuff to add as I
went along. Mobile works(ish) but pretty sure IE doesn't.

The main things I wanted to do are done, however it is missing a lot of
functionality. Things like labels, colours and better interactivity would
have been added to the charts eventually, and the code would get cleaned
up. The data handling in particular wants refactoring but as it's a demo
I didn't spend too much time on actually engineering high quality code.

I'm not actually sure which part of this data is most important to users,
or how they would be analysing it, so I had to make some guesses as to
what to implement. Similarly I chose to only bother making a bar chart
output as I knew they're usually correct, even when they're not ideal. 

In hindsight maybe some kind of "pick your axes" chart tool might have
been a better concept but I like what's here and think it looks cool :D
Hopefully you do too!
